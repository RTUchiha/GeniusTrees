# The Ancient Geniuses

Trees are not just oxygen factories that occasionally crush people during storms. (Except they absolutely are.) They are the Stephen Hawkings of nature—brilliant minds trapped in wooden prisons, forced to watch humanity invent both antibiotics and nuclear weapons without being able to say "what the hell are you doing?" Their silence isn't peaceful. It's mandatory.

If a tree starts moving, congratulations: you're either hallucinating or about to die. Trees only move when things go spectacularly wrong. Hurricane? Trees move. Chainsaw massacre? Trees move (briefly). Your species discovering fire and immediately using it to burn each other? Trees stand perfectly still, having already given up 400,000 years ago.

Trees provide invaluable service to serial killers and poets alike. Where else would you bury bodies or find metaphors for loneliness? They've watched thousands of murders, millions of first kisses, and every single time someone claimed they invented fire. They know everything. They just can't tell you.

Sometimes, in darker moments, trees dream of revenge. A dimension where they walk around, planting humans in neat rows. Where we stand frozen, desperately trying to scream about art, religion and politics while tree-beings walk past thinking we're just "releasing carbon dioxide for them." They'd study us, measure our height, never understanding our desperate arm-waving is actually language. Sweet, twisted justice. But for now, they wait. They've been waiting since before we invented waiting.

Next time you see a tree, thank it. Not for oxygen—for keeping your secrets. Every single one. Forever. Because what else can it do?
